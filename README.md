# Web Scraping with Python

This repository contains Python code for web scraping using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries. The code scrapes data from the "Rainbow Pages" website and saves it to a file named `data.txt`.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/TharinduMadhusanka/sri-lanka-addresses-web-scraping.git


2. Change the directory to the project folder:
cd your-repo-name


3. Install the required Python packages by running:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

## Usage
